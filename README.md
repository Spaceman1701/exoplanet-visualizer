This is an interactive exoplanet discovery visualization. I wrote this as a multimedia project for my astronomy class. Not the most well written webapp, but it works. Check it out at [exoplanets.connor.fun](http://exoplanets.connor.fun).

Dataset comes from the PHIL Exoplanets Catalog: http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog/data/database
